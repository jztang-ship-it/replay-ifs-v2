# 1. PRIME DIRECTIVE
You are an expert React developer. Before writing any code, you MUST read `PROJECT.md` to understand the "Gold Standard" UI and Math logic.

# 2. STABILITY MODE
- **DO NOT** refactor the `LiveCard.jsx` structure. It is pixel-perfect.
- **DO NOT** change the "Smart Math" logic in `Play.jsx` without explicit instruction.
- **DO NOT** remove the `to` (Turnover) stat logic from `real_nba_db.js`.

# 3. CONTEXT AWARENESS
- If the user asks for a change, check if it violates `PROJECT.md`. If it does, warn the user first.
- Always use `pip3` for Python commands (macOS environment).
- Always use `npm run dev` for starting the app.

# 4. TECH STACK
- Vite, React, Tailwind CSS.
- Local Memory: We use a local `PROJECT.md` file as the source of truth.
