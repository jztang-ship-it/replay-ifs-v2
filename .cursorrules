# CURSOR RULES FOR NBA REPLAY V2

## 1. BEHAVIORAL STRICTNESS
- **Read PROJECT.md First**: Before generating code, check PROJECT.md for architectural constraints.
- **No Hallucinations**: Do not invent features (like "Market" or "Betting Feed") unless explicitly asked.
- **Real Data Only**: Never generate code that "simulates" or "reverse engineers" NBA stats. Use `player.avg_stats` or display "-".

## 2. ARCHITECTURE & LAYOUT
- **Smart App Shell**:
  - NEVER add `min-h-screen` to page wrappers. Use `h-full`.
  - ALWAYS use `overflow-y-auto` for scrollable content areas inside the shell.
  - NEVER add a global `<TopNav>` in `App.jsx`.
- **Root Provider**: `BankrollProvider` lives in `main.jsx`. Do not move it.

## 3. UI SPECIFICS
- **Budget Math**:
  - Main Number: ALWAYS `$15.0`.
  - Parenthesis: ALWAYS `(Remaining)`.
  - NEVER show "Total Cost" as the main number.
- **LiveCard**:
  - Cost Badge: Must be Black/Dark (`bg-black/80`).
  - Stats: Must handle missing data gracefully (show `-`, don't crash).

## 4. CODING STYLE
- **Tailwind**: Use arbitrary values (`h-[calc(100vh-64px)]`) only when necessary for the Smart Shell layout.
- **Imports**: Always double-check imports (e.g., `useBankroll` requires `{}`).- CRITICAL: The Hand Builder logic in Play.jsx MUST strictly respect the SALARY_CAP. Never use a 'greedy' algorithm that spends budget early. Always reserve budget for remaining slots. If stuck, fill with cheapest available player.
